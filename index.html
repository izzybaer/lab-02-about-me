    <h1> All About Izzy </h1>

    <p> I am learning to be a programmer at Code Fellows! I am so excited to be here and on my way to a new career. Fun fact, in the last three years I've fallen in love with football! And yes - the Seahawks are my favorite team! </p>

    <h2> Is this career field a good fit for me? </h2>

    <p>Honestly? I have no fucking idea. Throughout the course of the last few weeks, I've thrown myself head first into the field of technology. By making the decision to attend Code Fellows and break out of the restaurant industry that has consumed the last thirteen years of my life, I am allowing myself to be vulnerable and open to new possibilities. Another fun fact, I have a Bachelor's degree in Arabic Studies and minor in Sociology!</p>

    <p>I've been telling myself that I am not smart enough, or capable enough intellectually, to be a programmer; the truth is that I am. I realized that yesterday when doing my first solo coding assignment, and suddenly a lightbulb went off. I thought to myself "I can do this. I am smart enough and capable enough to be a programmer." And now I'm going to make it happen. Fun fact, I worked and lived in Alaska as a gold miner a few summers ago. </p>
